# DesignCanvas Node Guide

English · [中文](NODES.md) · [Back to README](../README_EN.md)

DesignCanvas currently provides 10 nodes in three groups: **Variable**, **AI Generation**, and **Data Selection**. This guide covers their purpose, ports, primary actions, and common connection patterns.

## Workbench and connections

A new workspace starts with a blank canvas. Add nodes from the library on the left, then connect their ports to form control or data flows.

### Core rules

- **Control flow** determines execution order. Brief, Divergence, Idea Score, Content Extract, and Structured Plan have execution input and output ports.
- **Data flow** carries values such as `Text`, `TextStruct`, and `CardCollection`.
- Each input accepts one edge, except `Text[]` inputs, which accept multiple edges.
- A `TextStruct` input only accepts `TextStruct`; a `TextStruct` output can connect to `Text` or `Text[]` inputs.
- Workflows cannot contain cycles.
- Select a node in a control chain and use the toolbar run action to execute from that node downstream.

## Variable

### Card Variable

Card Variable is the workspace's idea-card pool. Divergence appends cards to it, and Idea Score writes scores back to those same cards.

- **Input:** None.
- **Output:** Card collection (`CardCollection`).
- **Primary actions:** Double-click to open the card pool; search, filter, vote, edit, delete, or inspect cards.
- **Connection constraint:** The pool inputs of Divergence and Idea Score must connect to a Card Variable.

After scoring, the Score Report tab compares cards across dimensions. Manual upvotes and downvotes take precedence over average scores in sorting and future-generation preferences.

## AI Generation

### Brief

Brief turns upstream text or a custom prompt into a game-system design brief. Use it to align goals and constraints before divergence or structured planning.

- **Input:** Optional control `exec`; optional text `source`.
- **Output:** Optional control `execOut`; Brief text `text`.
- **Primary actions:** Edit the prompt and fields such as title, background, target players, design goals, hard constraints, success metrics, and out-of-scope items.
- **Note:** Running requires a valid AI configuration. Without upstream text, generation relies only on the node prompt.

### Divergence

Divergence generates idea cards in batches from a requirement, upstream prompt, and selected ideation methods, then appends them to a Card Variable.

- **Input:** Optional control `exec`; card pool `pool`; optional text `prompt`.
- **Output:** Optional control `execOut`. Cards are written directly to the pool rather than emitted from a data output.
- **Primary actions:** Enter a requirement; infer methods with AI or select them manually; configure batch size, concurrency, and temperature.
- **Note:** `pool` must connect to a Card Variable. Later runs use existing votes and scores as preference signals.

### Idea Score

Idea Score first infers evaluation dimensions from context, then scores every idea in a card pool. Scores are written back to cards and used for ordering.

- **Input:** Optional control `exec`; card collection `cards`; optional text `context`.
- **Output:** Optional control `execOut`. Scores are written directly to the card pool.
- **Primary actions:** Infer dimensions, run batch scoring, and inspect the Score Report in the card pool.
- **Note:** `cards` must connect to a Card Variable. Running requires an AI configuration.

### Chat

Chat supports focused, multi-turn exploration around upstream text, card content, or reference material. Conversations are isolated from one another and persisted locally.

- **Input:** Text array `text`, accepting multiple incoming connections.
- **Output:** Structured text `context`, built from conversation turns marked for export.
- **Primary actions:** Create conversations, switch skills, edit the latest message, branch, and include or exclude turns from export.
- **Note:** Chat is outside control flow. Generating replies requires an AI configuration.

### Content Extract

Content Extract uses AI to summarize long upstream text, making it useful for capturing key points inside a control chain.

- **Input:** Optional control `exec`; text `input`.
- **Output:** Optional control `execOut`.
- **Primary actions:** Run the node and inspect its summary and status.
- **Note:** The summary is stored in node configuration and has no connectable text output. When upstream text changes, the existing summary becomes stale.

### Structured Plan

Structured Plan turns a Brief, chat result, or other text into game-system modules. Each module contains structured content such as an overview, rules, formulas, and acceptance conditions.

- **Input:** Optional control `exec`; text `input`.
- **Output:** Optional control `execOut`; current module collection `modules` (`TextStruct`).
- **Primary actions:** Inspect and edit modules; compare current and candidate versions; save the current version; view the document and dependency graph.
- **Note:** Only explicit systems and systems required by the core loop become modules. Saving the current version updates the official output and marks downstream nodes stale; AI regeneration first creates a latest candidate.

The dependency graph visualizes directional relationships between modules. Generate graphs separately for current and candidate versions, tune layout parameters, and inspect direct dependencies, indirect dependencies, and major paths. Editing a module marks the corresponding graph stale.

## Data Selection

### Card Content

Card Content selects one card from a Card Variable and formats it as plain text, commonly for connecting a single idea to Chat.

- **Input:** Card collection `cards`.
- **Output:** Text `content`.
- **Primary actions:** Select a card in the property panel; double-click the node to inspect card details.
- **Note:** This node does not participate in control flow.

### Text Select

Text Select chooses one item from a `TextStruct`, such as exported chat turns or Structured Plan modules, and converts it to plain text.

- **Input:** Structured text `input`.
- **Output:** Text `text`.
- **Primary actions:** Choose an item from the upstream list.
- **Note:** It only accepts a `TextStruct` source. If the upstream item is removed, the selected target is shown as invalid.

### Reference

Reference selects documents from the workspace reference library and provides their titles and bodies as cited text to Chat or other downstream nodes.

- **Input:** None.
- **Output:** Text array `text`.
- **Primary actions:** Add or import documents through the toolbar library, then select one or more references in the node.
- **Note:** Reference is outside control flow. Its `Text[]` output can be combined with other text sources connected to Chat.

## Typical workflows

### Idea card workflow

1. Add a Card Variable.
2. Connect the Divergence `pool` input to it, enter a requirement, and run the node.
3. Double-click the Card Variable to browse, filter, and vote on generated cards.
4. Connect Idea Score `cards` to the same Card Variable, infer dimensions, and run scoring.
5. Select one card through Card Content and connect its text to Chat for deeper exploration.

### Structured planning workflow

1. Select source material with Reference and connect it to Chat.
2. Discuss the design in Chat and mark useful turns for export.
3. Connect Chat `context` to Text Select and choose one item.
4. Connect the selected text to Brief or Structured Plan.
5. Review candidate modules, save an approved current version, and generate its dependency graph.
